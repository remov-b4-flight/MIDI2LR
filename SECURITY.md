# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recently released version is supported with security updates. For this reason, please keep your MIDI2LR installation updated. MIDI2LR will notify you at startup when a new version becomes available. The notification only appears once for each update.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs in MIDI2LR seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/rsjaffe/midi2lr/security/advisories/new) tab.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
